The Autosar standards categorize interfaces into three different categories. Autosar interfaces, standardized

Autosar interfaces and standardized interfaces.

And Autosar interface is a generic interface which is derived from the configurations.

Autosar interfaces are provided by the RTE and serve as an interface between application software

or between application software and the base software like hardware abstraction or complex device drivers.

For example, an application software might read input values and write output values via these interfaces

it can use to read or write APIs, which is derived from the configurations, and we shall see this

in more detail as the course progresses.

Standardized Autosar interface is a special Autosar interface predefined by the standard.

These type of interfaces are used by application software for access to our services, which are provided

by the BSW modules of the service layer, such as the ECU state manager or the diagnostics manager.

A standardized interface is an interface which is predefined by the Autosar standard as an API in the C

language.

It is used between BMW modules in an ECU or between the RTE and the operating system or between the

RTE and the BSW communication module.

For example, let's take the MCAL layer.

Autosar predefines a function API to use to read and IO pin, which is called the DIO_ReadChannel

..

These standardized interfaces can be accessed from other BSW layers to read a controller pin.

It's quite hard to imagine and understand this completely at this point of time, but at the end of

the course we shall see a live example, which I will once again specify these layer types which we saw now.

.

But for now, we shall just continue with a basic understanding on these three categories of interfaces

that Autosar specify.
