Before starting with the course, I have a short recommendation on the best way to approach this course

to get an effective learning.

Like already mentioned, the course can be divided into three categories, which is the Introduction, theory

and the demo part.

The Introduction will be quite generic on Autosar, which you'll be seeing first

and next we get into the theoretical session where things get interesting and informative, here will be learning on

what Autosar configuration is and its different features, methods, etc..

And we'll also learn how to choose the right configurations for our application.

During this theoretical session, we'll have lots of questions on the how to implement part, and this

will be covered in the next demo session that follows.

Autosar is quite a new conceptual topic, so please don't worry if something was not understandable

in the theory as the demo will cover the same topics in a practical way.

So consolidated three short hints from inside.

Since this is a completely new concept, please take the course continuously without any gaps so we don't

miss the continuation and understand Autosar better.

Second, while we are at demo, please interrelate it with the corresponding topics that were seen in

the theoretical session together.

Third, in case you have any questions, please feel free to post them on the Q&A section and I'll answer

them as quick as possible.

Although it's an online course, we try to make it as interactive as possible.

Wish you a good learning ahead on the course, and please do not forget to put the thumbs up as the course

progresses and your valuable rating and feedback really matters.

Thanks.

And we shall get started.
